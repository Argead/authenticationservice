Versioning Plan
 - Initial plan is to version the repo according to PEP440:
 - N.N indicates a final realease, according to a Major.Minor scheme
 - N.N.N indicates a micro-release as part of the larger N.N release
 - N.N.N.aN is an alpha realease
 - N.N.N.bN is a beta release
 - N.N.N.cN is a release candidate
 - N.N.N.devN is a development release
 - Project versions that move to the N.N final realease verion will be moved to a
   dedicated maintenance branch while work continues on new development or alpha versions.
